title: Merging pull requests
description: Conventions of how and when to merge pull requests at We Got POP
---

In general a pull request (PR) is only merged at the point that it is intended to release it and therefore merging is generally part of the release process.

There are exceptions, for example for changes to build tooling: where you are merging because you want synchronise a change across the development team.

## When not to merge

Do not merge a PR that has not been reviewed (in most cases Github will stop you from doing this).

Do not merge a PR if there is an outstanding review requesting changes. Instead resolve the issues with the reviewer and try and get the review status changed.

If the code reviewer is sick or on holiday and the need for the change is urgent, ask a Github admin to dismiss the review and get another reviewer to review the code taking into account the original reviewers concerns.
