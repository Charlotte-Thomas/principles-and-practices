title: Source Control

---

We use Git provided via Github as a our main source control tool.

We use [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) without release branches.

We generally squash merges into a single commit but some non-critical repos also use a rebase strategy, which is an experiment.
