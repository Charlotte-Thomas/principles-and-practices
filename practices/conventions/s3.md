S3 bucket names are universal amongst all AWS users and the name is used as the id of the bucket, therefore bucket naming conventions can be a bit strange.

## Public buckets

If a bucket is going to be public or you want the option for it to be at some point use the following convention:

```
<name or purpose>-wegotpop-com
```

## Application buckets

If the bucket holds data for an application and should be private then use the following convention:

```
popsss-<purpose>-<account/stage>
```
