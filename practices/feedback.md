# Giving feedback

Giving feedback is important. It helps people to understand what their strengths are and what contribution they really make to the team.

Giving and receiving feedback can be hard. When we get it right it makes people feel happier about themselves and more confident in their abilities. It also gives them concrete things to improve on and overcomes anxiety and worries like imposter syndrome.

## Giving good feedback

Feedback should focus first on identifying the strengths and contributions of the person you are giving feedback on.

Don't assume that because you understand that they are good at something that they necessary feel the same way. It is common for people to both over and underestimate their abilities.

Feedback should always use specific examples where possible to illustrate the feedback. Don't say "your work is great", instead try to say "your work on this feature was great".

When you want to give more difficult feedback where a colleague has had a negative impact on you then don't try to understand why someone may have done something. Just explain what happened from your point of view and how you felt about it.

For example:

> When you said you didn't have time to help me then I was really worried I wouldn't get the work done on time.

### Summary

The rough formula for good feedback is:

> When you did <the thing> it made me feel <the impact> 

## What feedback isn't

Often when we asked to give feedback we think we need to try create a critique or an analysis of another person. This is not true. Feedback is really just giving people an understanding of how what they do impacts others. More precisely it is telling people the impact they have on us personally.

### Feedback isn't "I like you"

Imagine someone told you were a great developer. You might feel happy about it but often we want to ask "why am I great developer"?

Including specific examples makes us think about **why** we think someone is good at something and helps the other persons understand what exactly it is that they do that helps other people.

When giving feedback read it back to yourself and check whether you are saying something concrete or just saying "I like you".

#### Examples of I like you

* You're so much fun!
* You know so much about React
* You're a really strong Python developer
* Working with you is really easy

### Avoid interpretation

We can sometimes hedge our feedback in assumptions about other people. Understanding other people's motivations can be hard and people can get upset when we try and tell them what they are feeling.

This is particularly true when we are talking about negative impacts people have on us.

#### Examples

* I know you're really busy but...
* You don't know a lot about frontend development
* I don't want to waste your time but...

This might be better expressed as:

* When you are late for our meetings I get worried that I don't know what is going on and whether you are going to turn up at all
* When you talk about frontend development I find it difficult to follow your arguments and understand what you mean
* I value it when you spend time with me and I'd like us to have more time together
