# Giving feedback

Giving feedback is important. It helps people to understand what their strengths are and what contribution they really make to the team.

Giving and receiving feedback can be hard. When we get it right it makes people feel happier about themselves and more confident in their abilities. It also gives them concrete goals and overcomes anxiety and things like imposter syndrome.

## Giving good feedback

Feedback should focus first on identifying the strengths and contributions of the person you are giving feedback on.

Don't assume that because you understand that they are good at something that they necessary feel the same way.

## What feedback isn't

Often when we asked to give feedback we think we need to try create a critique or an analysis of another person. This is not true. Feedback is really just giving people an understanding of how what they do impacts others. More precisely it is telling people the impact they have on us personally.

### Feedback isn't "I like you"
