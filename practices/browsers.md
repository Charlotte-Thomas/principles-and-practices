# Browsers

## Core browsers

Our core supported browser is:

* Evergreen Chrome

## Secondary browsers

A large part of our userbase uses Safari so we should try to support

* Safari 10 or higher

We should try to avoid breaking the following browsers but we should not make special efforts to support or workaround bugs in them:

* Edge
* Firefox
