title: Technical Roadmap Guidance
layout: page
---

Rather than having a formal technical roadmap we instead have guidance on particular technologies and the category they fall into.

Things marked **Do use** feel free to use where you want.

Things in **Retire** means that we still have code that uses this and it is okay to continue to use it where it is already in use but we should not create any more code using it. We should take the opportunities to remove it from our codebase where they arise.

Things marked as **Don't use** means that we have either retired this successfully or we have tried it and it hasn't worked out and should only be re-trialled if we have had a proper review of what did not work before and why things might now be different.
