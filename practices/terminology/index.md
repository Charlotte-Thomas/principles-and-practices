## Shared Language

When we use language amongst ourselves as developers it's important that we use terms in the same way so that we understand one another properly.

A lot of the terminology used in development is surprisingly flexible as ideas are often created but then co-opted to mean something other than its creator meant.

Ideally if we use other people's language we should try and keep to what the people meant when they invented the term (even if this may be a minority understand in the community generally) as it makes it easier to refer back to the original written definitions for a term rather than the informal meaning that has evolved around a given term.

Where we adopt a common meaning of a term it will usually be because the new meaning has become so ubiquitous that it is folly to try and keep to an outmoded version. In this case we should be clear to define what we understand by the term rather than hoping that a shared understanding will suffice as clearly shared understanding in these cases is really not very shared.
