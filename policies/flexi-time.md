title: Flexi-time
---

We do not have a formal company-wide flexi-time policy yet (but it is the process of being discussed). In the meantime flexi-time arrangements can worked out between developers and the Head of Development.

We want people to be able to work optimally and to reflect the different needs that people have. However we also need to balance the needs of the team and the individual to ensure that any arrangements do not have a negative effect on other team members and the team's overall work.
