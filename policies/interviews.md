title: Interview process
---

Our basic interview process consists of three stages:

1. A telephone interview
1. A pairing test
1. A face to face competency test

The ordering and timing may vary a lot, depending on your availability and preferences. In general though the face to face interview is usually the last step in the process.

## Telephone interview

This will involve an introduction to the company, a few light technical questions and for more senior or specialised roles a few questions about your experience in different areas.

Generally these questions will be a fixed set rather than ones tailored to your CV or background. We may also ask you to talk about any projects you have worked on previously and the problems you may have encountered implementing them.

We may do this interview via Google Hangouts or similar internet chat services.

## Pairing test

This is the key technical test. We use an extended version of the Guardian's pairing tests, you can [see the problems we will use](https://github.com/wegotpop/pairing-tests) in Github.

* You will be able to choose your language for the test
* You will be expected to come up with a solution or approach to the problem
* The test is done on a POP developers laptop not your own
* The test will happen at one of developer's desks
* You are allowed to access the internet during the test
* You can ask your pair for help or advice on the code

## Compentency test

This is a more formal interview and will generally be with two members of the development team.

You will be asked to provide specific examples of how you have demonstrated certain abilities or competencies in the past.

The questions will vary with the role you are applying for. In general, the more senior the role, the more questions.

You do not have to answer all the questions and it would be better to acknowledge that you don't have experience in a particular area than to make up an answer.

### Specialised tests

If you are interviewing for a more specialised role there may be a different or additional technical test based around the skills needed by the role you are applying for. We do not yet have enough examples of these tests to publish them.

## Dress code

The POP office is casual dress so there's no need to dress up in a suit or other formal attire unless you'd like to.

## Feedback

We will always try to provide you with feedback with five working days of your interview. If you are successful the interview feedback will generally focus on what performance we will expect from you in your probation period and any issues we'd like to try and address. This will mesh into the general career progression discussions you will part of.

If unsuccessful we will try and highlight they key issues for us. In some cases we may want to get back in touch with you if your circumstances change or ours. As a growing business sometimes our answer may simply be a "not now" instead of "no".
