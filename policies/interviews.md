title: Interview process

Our basic interview process consists of three stages:

1. A telephone interview
1. A face to face competency test
1. A pairing test

## Telephone interview

This will involve an introduction to the company, a few light technical questions and for more senior or specialised roles a few questions about your experience in different areas.

We may do this interview via Google Hangouts or similar internet chat services.

## Compentency test

This is a more formal interview and will generally be with two members of the development team.

You will be asked to provide specific examples of how you have demonstrated certain abilities or competencies in the past.

The questions will vary with the role you are applying for. In general, the more senior the role, the more questions.

You do not have to answer all the questions and it would be better to acknowledge that you don't have experience in a particular area than to make up an answer.

## Pairing test

This is the key technical test. We use an extended version of the Guardian's pairing tests, you can [see the problems we will use](https://github.com/wegotpop/pairing-tests) in Github.

* You will be able to choose your language for the test
* You will be expected to come up with a solution or approach to the problem
* The test is done on a POP developers laptop not your own
* The test will happen at one of developer's desks
* You are allowed to access the internet during the test
* You can ask your pair for help or advice on the code

### Specialised tests

If you are interviewing for a more specialised role there may be a different or additional technical test based around the skills needed by the role you are applying for. We do not yet have enough examples of these tests to publish them.
