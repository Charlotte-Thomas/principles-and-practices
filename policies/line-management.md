## During probation

During your probation period you will be line managed by the relevant head of your area (engineering or quality). After probation your line management may change.

## Catchups

You and your line manager will schedule fortnightly catchups. These may have to change times and dates according to holidays and other circumstances but you should have a regular opportunity to discuss things with your manager.

You should be able to discuss how things are going, any problems you may be experiencing, answer questions about the business in general, progress on your objectives and career development. Your line manager can also answer or find the answer to questions you may have about the business in general or other teams.

Generally you should be prepared for your catchups and think about what you want to discuss before the meeting itself.
