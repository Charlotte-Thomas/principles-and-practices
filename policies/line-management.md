# Line management

During your probation period you will be line managed by the relevant head of your area (engineering or quality). After probation your line management may change.

## Catchups

You and your line manager will schedule fortnightly catchups. These may have to change times and dates according to holidays and other circumstances but you should have a regular opportunity to discuss how things are going, any problems you may be experiencing, progress on objectives and career development.
