If you are sick please contact your line manager before 10am. This can by via email or Slack.

In general, if you are ill you should not work on a day you take off due to illness. POP will try not to contact you unless it is very urgent.

In general you should contact your line manager each day you are ill, if you know you will be ill for a few days though you can prearrange a period of sickness and not have to check-in each morning.

We are now recording sick days in CharlieHR so please update as needed.

## Working while ill

If you are ill please do not try to work while taking sick leave, we would prefer for you to focus on recovering.

If you feel fine but have an infectious period then on a case by case basis you can work from home.
