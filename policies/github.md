Developers can either associate their personal account with the We Got POP organisation or create a new account just for use with POP.

If you choose to use your personal account then you agree that you will obey the company rules regarding Github profiles, namely that:

* You add your name to the account
* Your profile picture should be a reasonably representative photo of you (ideally your POP profile picture)
* You enable MFA on your account
* You obey the organisation's password rules

The advantage of using your own personal account is that your activity will be recorded against your account.
