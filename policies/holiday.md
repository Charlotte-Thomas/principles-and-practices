## Holiday

Holiday can be requested by emailing the Head of Development and cc'ing in the calendar manager.

Most holiday requests will be honoured but there might need to be some compromise around popular times of the year (August and December) and very short notice requests.

The holiday year runs from January to December and is pro-rated on that basis.

## Attending conferences

If you are attending a conference as part of your agreed personal development or on behalf of the company then that time will be paid.

If you want to attend a conference that is not related to POP then you would be expected to take that as leave.

## Flexi-time

Flexi-time is based on individual needs and is agreed between you and your line manager. Common agreeements are a change in daily start and end times or working from home on recurring days.

## Requesting leave

Ideally you will request leave at least seven days before you take it. If you need time off at short notice for emergencies then just let the head of engineering know.
