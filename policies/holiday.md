# Holiday

Holiday can be requested by emailing the Head of Development and cc'ing in the calendar manager.

Most holiday requests will be honoured but there might need to be some compromise around popular times of the year (August and December) and very short notice requests.

The holiday year runs from January to December and is pro-rated on that basis.
