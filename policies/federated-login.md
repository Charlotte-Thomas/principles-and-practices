title: Use of federated login
---

Where a service supports sign-in via your personal Github account or POP Google account it is preferable to use that federated sign-in than using a password.

Federated logins via other services like Twitter are less appropriate as these are not services that we have company adminstration for.

This is because there is no need to enter a password which might be captured by a key logger or to have an additional interaction with a password manager like 1Password.
