This is a collection of high-level advice and guidance that covers all of the POP projects and deliverables.

It is written primarily for the development team and represents the common practices the team should try to adhere too. Changes and proposals should be made via a PR to the relevant repo. See the CONTRIBUTING document for more information.

It is a public document to help share our experience and as a thank you to other teams that have shared their ideas with us.
