# How to propose changes

Raise a PR with your change and give the following context in the PR:

* what in summary is being proposed?
* how has it got to being proposed?

If relevant also include:

* what alternatives were discussed before the change was arrived at?

## Passive-aggression warning

Don't add a PR relating to your personal preferences or aesthetics.

Don't raise a PR around something that you haven't discussed with people first.

This document is not a way to get other developers to do something you'd like them to do.

## Best practice warning

"Best practice" consists of both a practice and a context. To be relevant to POP the practice has to solve a problem we have and the context has to be appropriate and relevant to our current development team.
